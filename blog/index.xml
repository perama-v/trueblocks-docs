Are there ways to get ERC20 token balance for a given account address? Yes. There is. In fact, this is one of TrueBlocks&amp;rsquo; most important features. Simply do chifra export --statements &amp;lt;address(es)&amp;gt; or query the API serve with http://localhost:8080/export?addr=&amp;lt;address&amp;gt;&amp;amp;statements.
Note that chifra export has many, many other options which produce similarly-informative data such as --logs, --appearances, --neighbors, --accounting, and so on. See the entire help file with chifra export --help.</description></item><item><title>forEveryChain</title><link>/blog/foreverychain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 10:45:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/foreverychain/</guid><description>Have you ever had the desire to look at every trace of every transaction of every block on every blockchain? Yes? Well, pull up a chair and visit with us for a while.
It’s a Multi-Chain World I’m sure many of you are aware of the coming &amp;ldquo;multi-chain&amp;rdquo; universe of blockchains. You know the one. The one where all sorts of little baby communities of people are going to be doing all sorts of little baby community-like things.</description></item><item><title>Installing Erigon and TrueBlocks as Services on Ubuntu</title><link>/blog/installing-erigon-and-trueblocks-as-services-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:10:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/installing-erigon-and-trueblocks-as-services-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>One of our users (Magnus Hansson) has written an excellent article on how to install all three of Erigon, Erigon&amp;rsquo;s RPC, and TrueBlocks as serives on Ubuntu.

Not only that &amp;ndash; the blog post is visually wonderful as well.
Thanks Magnus. Looking for some amazing data science from this quarter.

This is short recipe to accomplish just that.
Preliminaries The first thing to understand is that the TrueBlocks core runs against a local configuration file stored in your $HOME folder called $HOME/.local/share/TrueBlocks/trueBlocks.toml. It&amp;rsquo;s an almost ridiculously simple file.
The file gets created and populated with default values the first time you build TrueBlocks.</description></item><item><title>Recipe: Getting Erc20 Transfer Events</title><link>/blog/recipe-getting-erc20-transfer-events/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 08:00:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/recipe-getting-erc20-transfer-events/</guid><description>A TrueBlocks recipe to show every ERC20 Transfer event from a given smart contract.
Note: The following assumes you have a copy of (either by having built it yourself or downloaded it) the TrueBlocks Appearance Index. These instructions also assume that the address you&amp;rsquo;re querying is an ERC 20 smart contract.
Preliminaries To get started, we want to extract (from the TrueBlocks index) a list of every transaction that our address has ever appeared in.</description></item></channel></rss>
